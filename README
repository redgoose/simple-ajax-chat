simple ajax chat
====================

notes
---------------------

just needed an app to chat with one other person on a network that had google chat blocked.

didn't want this to get blocked as well, so there's no polling for updates.
updates occur when using the ~ button or pressing enter.

features
---------------------

* php, jquery, json, sqlite db
* low bandwidth, only fetches changes
* no polling (easy to add in if you need it)
